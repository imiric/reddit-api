# reddit-api

  A lightweight promise-based Reddit API wrapper.

## Why?

  Because [the](https://github.com/timisbusy/handson-reddit)
  [existing](https://github.com/Stebon24/redwrap) Reddit API
  [wrappers](https://github.com/cha0s/reddit-api) are mostly intended to be
  used on the server where the size of the dependencies is not a concern.
  [Request](https://github.com/mikeal/request/) and
  [superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) are great libraries,
  but loading 20KiB of code that will likely go unused in the browser just
  because it simplifies my life as a developer is not very nice.

## Installation

  Install with [component(1)](http://component.io):

    $ component install imiric/reddit-api

## API

  TBD
